TODO

1.2
- add user-dependent settings, like 'startPage', 'language'
- do round the duration
- if rounding is on the tasks with "not need a project" dont get rounded durations

other todo's
- let users ONLY see their data, and the data they are allowed to see!!!
  depending on their projects, etc.
- turn off a user for a day when he tries to hack something, like 'You dont have permission ...' see time-class
- let SimpleTemplate add width and height tags in img
- translate the text which is in the OO-templates
- select last used project in Today-Log  
- translate info-mail from admin/user page!
- let user stay on the same page when using the "hot keys"
- if rounding result is the same time, dont show message (it does now because the seconds are different)

projectTree
- add the accountName to the projectTree.js.tpl-cacheKey, so the asp-version also caches
  the tree account-dependent, it does it now too, because on timetool.biz every
  account has a differnt url and PHP_SELF is in the cache key, but we cant be sure
  that it is always this way!
- use it for showing the projects on the projects-edit page
- enable a non-js tree view, somehow :-)
- when calling getAll/getNode walk through the entire tree and set isAvailable
  so the isAvailable method in projectTree wont be necessary anymore and this increases
  speed since we read the tree joined with projectTree2user
- do cache time end at the closest date a project is closed
- update all js-treeViews when one is rebuilt, this way we could remove the
  complicated dependencies caching (this stuff: 3_projectTree*.js.php)
- ADMIN mode: updating the tree will only be done if something that is relevant for the current
  user has changed :-( but in admin mode every change should cause an update!!!!
- throw warnings to admin when there are projects which have no team members
  since those projects are useless (and the caching doesnt work properly for those :-( )
- add 'update project tree' button!!! in the tree-view
  
- rewrite the projectTree use, switch to Dyn where possible
  * switch isClosed(), isAvailable(), etc. to Dyn
- if there is a time booked for today and one for tomorrow, the headline bar is wrong 
  becuase the duration for the today-task is already  calculated
- let the admin allow a project manager to add sub projects to his project
- in the project-drop-downs let user select by typing the first letter too (JS)
- somehow the reload mechanism doesnt work properly, and if you enter info and after the
  sumbit you get to the login page again, this sucks a lot too! let a site also tell if
  post-data shall be reposted after re-login ... somehow ...
- leave times in chronological order in the export files!!!
- let the translation not translate project names, etc. ONLY in the messages this still occurs!!!
  i.e. try it with naming a project 'Start' it will become 'Beginn' in german :-(
- check if uploaded OO-template really is OO-file, do some more checking in the unzip stuff
- use I18N to format date, time in all places
- align the status line always at the bottom of the screen, not of the page!
- handle wrong db's in ASP version
- avoid failure logins, limit a 'Gehen' to be within at least i.e. 14 hours
  i.e. if i booked 'Gehen' yesterday it recognizes the first time and after that maximum 14h a gehen has to be locked
- filter by number of hours
- add a file, like: getJs.php?file=/common/js/common.js
  which parses the JS file first and removes comments, etc. to make it a bit unreadable
- check if a user is assigned to a project, then he cant be removed at all
- highlight last saved data sets, esp. in quick log
- quick-log show the data agin if an error occured when saving
- add automatic closing of JS-windows when the page has expired, dont use the reload as it is implemented
  now in the header.tpl, simply use window.close for js-windows!!!
- read keyboard keys like 'pause' etc. and log those events ...
- day-log log-mode to log in by giving the hours...
- extract error messages and put them in an extra file and refer to them only via
  constants - and show error-codes such as '0003'
- vacation, overtime
- sollstunden
- alow additional links to a project, which can be user defined, such as
  'Pflichtenheft' - 'http://url...'
- minor bug showing accessible projects:
  project1 | project2   project2 i have rights on, but it is expired
  so it's not shown, but project1 is shown, because we show the entire tree to it
  but since i have no rights on it anyway hide it!
- when creating a project optionally inherit team members and managers
- you can not remove a user from a project if he has already booked times on this project
- summarize hours, i.e. for export, say i want all hours for this project but summarized over users
  i am not interested in what userX did and userY i only want the sum of the day/week ...
- clean up the export
  - create methods which write data into a file
  - extract the OO-unzip-stuff
  - the printView.php is still a bit messy!
- let user choose images for tasks
- holidays, let the admin specify the holidays for a year
  so the overview (that we will show one day) can show the working days, the amount of time worked
  and the holidays within
- save specials/holdiays not for days which are holidays
- add-dialogs - show them only when 'new' button was pushed, they are disturbing always on the top of the page
  OR/AND intelegently show 'add' dialog only when used quite often i.e. after new install
  if not used for X times hide the add-dialog and show a 'new' button
- add optional url to each project, to link companies i.e.
- export in CSV
- overview of current tasks of each user, what is the user currently working on, since when
- remove project - check for all the children if they have times or prices, etc.
- 'select all' buttons
- put the 3 most used projects/tasks on top of the select boxes
- protocolling, history of entries
- create the project tree structure on the file system in a given dir and create offers
  and offer-numbers on demand. the offer will be given as uploaded file, where the designated tags
  for project name, etc. will only have to be replaced and the offer will be saved in the right
  directory etc...
  do also create the bills, which is much alike the offer stuff
- make it easy to copy/move times from one project to another

permissions
- give users permission to log time for special projects (i.e. user X is only allowed to book on the project Y and no other)
- give user permission to see projects
- give permissions to see prices
- permission to remove times of himself and of other users
- when installing ask for a user with admin rights, that user can also
  give other users the right to give rights, but the admin will always have to keep
  his rights!



DONE
v2.1
- update INSTALL to reflect config-local.php
- make rounding as discussed
- add km-log
- implement default # of hours per user
- do the translation of the new stuff

- move project manager to member and vice versa
- project/team.php move the members via JS and change the 'done' button into 'save'
- encode the OO-text's properly, i dont know how to do that now ... but hey we get it
  try spanish this gives an error, since 'duracï¿½on' is not encoded :-(
- CSV export
- dont let not-admins seeadmin pages, i.e. user
- css-link is wrong and is ALWAYS redirected, this is unnecessary traffic
- let project managers add team members
- project-valid-time: check if a project has times outside the new range
  and set the project valid time as needed!!!
- finish L10N to use in Overview-by date
- prefill date-follow ups in the multi-log, so people dont have to select the date every time
  it intelligently uses the last date
- 'kommen' doesnt work when the last project is not available anymore!!!
- translate JavaScript stuff
- make nice messages box, where we show the errors and messages as on telefonmarkt
- give a user admin rights, but if he wants to be admin then he HAS to switch into admin mode!
- close a project's period, so that a project's data cant be changed before the date when it was closed
  this is very important for the time after a bill has been written, the data should not be changed anymore
  otherwise the bill would not correspond to the numbers in the timetool
- optionally round times when exporting/showing
  save the settings how to round for each project, all subprojects will use the same
  rounding if nothing else is given for them
- add an input mode, which allows it to work only with the keyboard
  which auto corrects dates from 220802 to 22.08.2002 and the same with times, as i used to have
  it and let the user enter times fast this way, precondition are the fix project numbers, i think
  i.e. let the user enter   220802    TAB    1010    TAB    1100    TAB    11#12    <save button>
  which means               22.08.2002  from:10:10      til:11:00   project:11 task:12
  - multilog!
- use project number to identify a project easily (Kostenstelle-like) - can be done in multilog now!
- save the last time properly, when i log in a time now and have no follow up the
  duration is wrong - duration is 0 now!
- multilog
- time/index.php - on 'save as new' and that fails we dont get to see the data again :-(
- generate print preview without the need to push the show button first
- when saving of a time failed because of the projects-validation period
  and not the project itself, but a parent is not available at this period
  the message 'valid from ... through ... ' is not shown properly - for now we dont show the period!
- make it easy to check in a 'urlaub' - holiday
- make the join-query in the price-class work
- if folding in projects but a sub projects subproject is unfolded it will be shown anyway
  check if any parent along the path is hidden, if so hide all the children too
- add start and enddate for projects
- add remove buttons for tasks
- overview - select the current user if noone is selected
- allow search for comments too
- use tree to structure the data/projects
- remove escaped \'
