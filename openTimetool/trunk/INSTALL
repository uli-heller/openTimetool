REQUIREMENTS
- running mysql server, apache and php
- you should be able to open i.e. http://localhost in your local webbrowser


INSTALL
1. DB
   - create DB openTimetool, i.e. using phpMyAdmin (http://phpmyadmin.sf.net)
   - import the mysql.sql in the DB openTimetool that you have created in the step before
2. Apache setup - .htaccess
   - adjust the htdocs/.htaccess accordingly to your settings
     actually you will only need to adjust the "auto_prepend" option.
     you need to adjust the path to the openTimetool,.
   - NOTE: 
       * in your apache configure the option "AllowOverride All" (i.e. /etc/httpd/httpd.conf) 
       * if your apache uses php with the suhosin security extension (aka hardened php) 
         installed, export to openoffice-templates wont't work unless you deactivate the 
	 session-encryption: in your php-initfile
	 (i.e. /etc/php/apache2-php5/ext-active/suhosin.ini) find and set 
	 "suhosin.session.encrypt = Off"
3. config-local.php
   - since version 2.1 the application needs to be configured using the config-local.php
     this file doesnt get delivered with the distribution, this has the advantage that 
     your configuration will stay on your machine, even when you update and extract a new version
     over the files in the openTimetool directory
   - if you have no config-local.php on your system yet, simply rename the config-local.php.dist
   - the config-local.php has to be located in the application's root directory (should be
     here where this file is)
     i.e. /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/openTimetool/config-local.php
   - modify the config-local.php accordingly, all the values you would need to 
     change are described properly in the file
4. create symbolic links
   - create a symbolic link to the htdocs directory for every language you want
     to have available, also for english!
     You need to create a symbolic link in the htdocs directory to itself, 
     with the required language (best you do it for all the available languages).
     Normally like this:
        cd /in/your/openTimetool/htdocs
        ln -s . en
        ln -s . es
        ln -s . de
     This is needed to provide a unique path to every language. Of course you need
     to have the followSymLink option turned on in your apache!
   - make the htdocs/tmp directory !and all subdirectories, if there are any! read and 
     writeable for the webserver process, i.e. using   
        chmod a+w tmp

and you should be ready to go ...
     
     
DEFAULT LOGIN
After you have installed the application you can log in for the first time
with 
    Username    root
    Password    root
This person is also admin. And you need the admin to add new users!
    
    
    
Have fun with the openTimetool
