If you run openTimetool on a server where PHP runs as FastCGI you most probably will have
major problems :

One of the most important lines within the whole openTimetool package is
this one in that file :

php_value auto_prepend_file <docroot>/openTimetool/config.php

PHP as FastCGI will silently ignore that line!
