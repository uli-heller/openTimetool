This application makes use of some PEAR packages. They are included here for convenience.
If you want to use the original PEAR packages you have to do the following :

1) 	Make sure that the PEAR packages "Benchmark","DB", "HTTP" and "Log" are 
	installed on your system
2) 	Make sure that you have added the path to the PEAR top-directory in your include path 
	(php.ini or config.php of openTimetool)


Afterwards openTimetool is working with the installed 4 PEAR packages mentioned above. You 
can easily update them with pear installer from then on (for instance with "pear upgrade Log")


NOTE : The XINE engine and I18N are PEAR packages as well. But they weredeveloped by the 
former developer of openTimetool "Wolfgang Kiesing". Wolfgang doesn't maintain openTimetool 
anymore and so he doesn't the XINE engine and I18N from PEAR. As the current PEAR versions are 
hard coded for PHP4, we don't use them and maintain these beasts in this application from now on. 
Some changes for PHP5 compatibility are already implemented though.
